# Heisenberg spin model

### Project realised under NCN grant 
### supervisor: Paweł Potasz

This reposetory contains backup of my work done during scholarship at UMK (Paweł Potasz). It is about Heisenberg model 
and DMRG. Codes are written in python. 
* 1D chain Heisenberg spin generator
* Graph Heisenberg spin 
* Density matrix from Heisenberg spin chain 
* Reduced density matrix calculation from Heisenberg 1D spin chain 
* Entropy of the corresponding subsytems
